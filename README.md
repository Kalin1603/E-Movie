## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get eMovies running locally:

**1. Prerequisites:**

* [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0) or later
* [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) (Express, Developer, or other editions) or another configured EF Core compatible database.
* Development Environment (e.g., Visual Studio 2022+, VS Code)

**2. Clone the Repository:**

```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME/eMovies.git with the actual repository URL if applicable
git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/eMovies.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/eMovies.git)
cd eMovies
3. Configure Application Secrets:

It's highly recommended to use User Secrets for sensitive data like connection strings and email credentials, especially during development.

Initialize User Secrets (if not already done):
Bash

dotnet user-secrets init
Set Database Connection String:
Bash

# Adjust the connection string for your specific SQL Server instance
dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection" "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=eMoviesDb_Dev;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true;TrustServerCertificate=True"
Set Email Settings (Optional): If you want to test email functionality:
Bash

dotnet user-secrets set "EmailSettings:SmtpServer" "smtp.example.com"
dotnet user-secrets set "EmailSettings:Port" "587" # Or your provider's port
dotnet user-secrets set "EmailSettings:SenderName" "eMovies Notifications"
dotnet user-secrets set "EmailSettings:SenderEmail" "[email address removed]"
dotnet user-secrets set "EmailSettings:Username" "your_smtp_username"
dotnet user-secrets set "EmailSettings:Password" "your_smtp_password"
(Alternatively, configure these in appsettings.Development.json for local testing only, but do not commit credentials to source control).
4. Restore Dependencies:

Bash

dotnet restore
5. Apply Database Migrations:

This command creates the database (if it doesn't exist) and applies the schema based on the EF Core migrations defined in the project.

Bash

dotnet ef database update
6. Run the Application:

Bash

dotnet run
The application will start, and the console output will show the URLs where it's accessible (e.g., https://localhost:xxxx and http://localhost:yyyy).

7. Explore! Open your web browser and navigate to one of the provided URLs. Register a new account or use seeded credentials (if applicable) to start exploring the eMovies application.
